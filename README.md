diamKER kernel
============

This Kernel is developed by diam Systems for use in diam Operating Systems such as, diamOS (Starting from diamOS Cruel Summer)

diamKER is currently in Alpha.

diamKER is based upon Linux so the build instructions and basic project file directories are the same.

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the reStructuredText markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
